# My first React APP

Built this simple blog app using react. Thanks to tutorials from TheNetNinja on YT.

## Why React?

As a full stack developer who enjoys working with with laravel and livewire, I had to start learning react beacuse of the demand. So far, I find it good and I pray to keep improving my skills on it, not just for jobs, but for me to be able to teach others and to build build projects with it.
